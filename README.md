# Fish-Inveterates-Photo-Survey
my First python EDA project

These datasets were retrieved from the Moris Kahn marine research database.
The dataset is a photo survey of Invertebrates and Fish from different sites along the Israeli coastline.
In the process of the eda we highlighted some of the interesting findings and implemented
 Population Stability Index to announce the most stable site.
